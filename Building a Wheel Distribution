Now that you know the tools works it’s time to build it for distribution. Build a wheel for the package and use it to install the hr tool on your system.

Note: This package doesn’t support Python 3, so it is not a “universal” package.

Extra metadata file:

MANIFEST.in

include README.rst
recursive-include tests *.py
Using the pipenv shell, this is the command that you would run to build the wheel:

$ python setup.py bdist_wheel
Lastly, here’s how you would install this wheel for the root user to be able to use (run from project directory):

$ sudo pip install --upgrade dist/hr-0.1.0-py2-none-any.whl
